# AngelList Syndicate List

## Summary

Need to find which syndicate lead to approach on AngelList?
Frustrated by the fact that AngelList won't let you search syndicates?
No more!

## To Run

Clone the project. The run "bundle install" to install dependencies. Then run:

```
bin/export.rb
```

It'll take a loooong time - it's aggregating the tags for every startup that every syndicate lead has every invested in.

Eventually you'll get a file "syndicates.csv". Do what you need to do.

## License

Do whatever you want. I disavow responsibility for any consequences of actually running this script.
